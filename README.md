## Getting Started



### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
gh repo clone Noroff-FEU-Assignments/project-exam-1-HGarden
```

### Running

To get the page up and running you will need a way to either run the page locally or use an external provider like [netlify](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwieqMfD3cL9AhX7AxAIHSQdBUgQFnoECAwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netlify.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3sXtvDCHEM_yMr7dqTH7xl)

Simply link netlify to your repo and it should be up and running.

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
